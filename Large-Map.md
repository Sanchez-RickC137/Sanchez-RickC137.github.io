## Project description

Solving the common Computer Science problem of storing and searching based on key-value pairs, utilizing only arrays or linked lists. Creates an efficient map of students given a first name, last name and a student id and tests the efficiency based on the run time of a pair of functions. The get() function retrieves the student id based on the first and last name. The howMany() function returns the number of students with a given prefix. The performance of the functions is time based.

## How to compile and run the program

- Compile and run the performance analyis of the get() function for the data structure
```bash
make run-get
```

- Generate the plot based off the get() data
```bash
make dataGet
```

- Compile, performance analysis and plot generation
```bash
make run-get dataGet
```

- Compile and run the performance analyis of the get() function for the data structure
```bash
make run-howMany
```

- Generate the plot based off the get() data
```bash
make dataHow
```

- Compile, performance analyis and plot generation
```bash
make run-howMany dataHow
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
