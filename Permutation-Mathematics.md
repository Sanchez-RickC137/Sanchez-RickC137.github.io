## Project description

The program generates all possible permutations of the numbers 1 through 9 to solve the given problem "_ / _ * _ + _ * _ * _ / _ + _ * _ = 100" where each blank represents a number from 1 to 9 with no numbers repeated.

## How to compile and run the program

- Compilation
```bash
g++ -Wextra -o main main.cpp
```

- Running
```bash
./main
```

## UI Design
There is no user input for this program. The output is command-line based and consists of all the solutions for the given mathematics equation.

## 3. Additional Considerations
The program is designed to find every permutation to solve a math problem, but the math problem could be changed to solve a different problem or some of the code could be utilized for the purposes of simple permutation generation.
